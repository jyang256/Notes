              what is cloud computing?
          </h3>
          cloud computing is on demand computing resources, delivered to you over the internet

      </header>
      <ul>

          It's a computer service you traditionally did local, now performed remotely, across the internet.
          <li>
              clouds are elastic - virtually unlimited space 
          </li>
          <li>
              SCALABLE... in case you dont want to pay as much
          </li>
          <li>
              METETERED - pay for what you need
          </li>
          <li>
              cloud is SELF SERVICE- no need or almost no need for IT experts
          </li>
          <li>
              applications are not running locally - running In THE CLOUD
          </li>
          <li>
              Think Google's dumb game console - games run on the cloud
          </li>
          <li>
              cloud computing - only pay for waht you need, fast access to applications
          </li>
          <li>
              may eliminate the need for local IT staff since apps are maintained on the cloud 

          </li>
          <li>
              potential to LOWER COSTS 
          </li>
          <li>
              self-service
          </li>
          <li>

          risks of cloud computing
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
            You are placing your trust in the cloud provider - susceptible to slowdowns in the cloud 
        </li>
        <li>
            potential for data loss - need multiple backups, including other clouds 
        </li>
        <li>
            potential to slow access to your data 
        </li>
        <li>
            since cloud is remote, you may need to pay attention to laws and stuff
        </li>
        <li>
            potential loss of customization
